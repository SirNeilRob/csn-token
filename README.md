Solana Launchpad Template – Token-2022 Implementation

A secure and extensible token launchpad contract built on Solana using the Token-2022 standard. Includes support for fixed supply tokens, controlled minting, time-locked vesting, and PDA-managed authority controls.

🚀 Overview
This launchpad provides a reusable Solana smart contract framework for launching SPL Token-2022 assets with enhanced controls, supply caps, and vesting schedules. 
Originally built for the CSN token, this template can be customized for any project.

✨ Key Features
Fixed Supply Enforcement: Cap total minted tokens at a preset maximum
Time-Locked Minting: Restrict minting frequency (e.g., once per year)
Authority Controls: Only authorized accounts can mint
Token-2022 Support: Built using the SPL Token-2022 standard
Secure PDA-based State: For mint authority and timestamp tracking
Built-in Burn Function: Token holders can burn their own tokens
Vesting Ready: Compatible with time-based token distribution via custom logic

🏗️ Architecture
Core Modules
State Account: Stores mint authority, timestamps, and supply limits using a Program Derived Address (PDA)
Mint Logic: Enforces mint frequency and total supply constraints
Burn Logic: Allows holders to burn tokens without approval
Optional Extensions:
Vesting schedules per user or allocation type
Freeze or pause authority
DAO governance integration

🧱 Example Token Distribution
The original implementation included:
Staking Rewards: 40%
Treasury: 15%
Initial DEX Offering (IDO): 14%
Liquidity Pools: 4%
Marketing: 7%

Customize these values for your tokenomics model.

🛠️ Development Setup
Prerequisites

Rust 1.88
Solana CLI 2.2.19
Anchor 0.31.1

Local Setup

git clone https://github.com/SirNeilRob/sol-launchpad-temp.git
cd sol-launchpad-temp
npm install
anchor build
anchor test

🔧 Smart Contract Instructions
Sets up the state account (PDA)
Assigns mint authority
Initializes timestamps and counters

mint_token
Mints new tokens (authority-only)

Enforces total supply cap
Enforces mint time-lock
Updates internal state
burn_token
Burns tokens from the holder’s account

No permission required

🔒 Security Highlights
Total Supply Cap: Prevents over-minting
Time-Locked Minting: Prevents abuse by authority
PDA-Based State: Ensures tamper-resistant authority tracking
Modular Design: Easily auditable and extendable

📝 TODO

 Add multi-signature minting support
 Integrate DAO-based governance
 Freeze/Thaw token accounts
 Additional automated tests and fuzzing
