Solana Launchpad Template – Token-2022 Implementation
A secure and extensible token launchpad contract built on Solana using the Token-2022 standard. Includes support for fixed supply tokens, controlled minting, time-locked vesting, and PDA-managed authority controls.

🚀 Overview
This launchpad provides a reusable Solana smart contract framework for launching SPL Token-2022 assets with enhanced controls, supply caps, and vesting schedules. Originally built for the CSN token, this template can be customized for any project.

✨ Key Features
Fixed Supply Enforcement: Cap total minted tokens at a preset maximum

Time-Locked Minting: Restrict minting frequency (e.g., once per year)

Authority Controls: Only authorized accounts can mint

Token-2022 Support: Built using the SPL Token-2022 standard

Secure PDA-based State: For mint authority and timestamp tracking

Built-in Burn Function: Token holders can burn their own tokens

Vesting Ready: Compatible with time-based token distribution via custom logic

🏗️ Architecture
Core Modules
State Account: Stores mint authority, timestamps, and supply limits using a Program Derived Address (PDA)

Mint Logic: Enforces mint frequency and total supply constraints

Burn Logic: Allows holders to burn tokens without approval

Optional Extensions:

Vesting schedules per user or allocation type

Freeze or pause authority

DAO governance integration

🧱 Example Token Distribution
The original implementation included:

Staking Rewards: 40%

Treasury: 15%

Initial DEX Offering (IDO): 14%

Liquidity Pools: 4%

Marketing: 7%

Customize these values for your tokenomics model.

🔧 Smart Contract Instructions
initialize
Sets up the state account (PDA)

Assigns mint authority

Initializes timestamps and counters

mint_token
Mints new tokens (authority-only)

Enforces total supply cap

Enforces mint time-lock

Updates internal state

burn_token

No permission required

🔒 Security Highlights
Total Supply Cap: Prevents over-minting

Time-Locked Minting: Prevents abuse by authority

PDA-Based State: Ensures tamper-resistant authority tracking

Modular Design: Easily auditable and extendable

📝 TODO
 Add multi-signature minting support
